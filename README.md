# implements Renderable, Animatable

## Overview
*implements Renderable, Animatable* is a 3D visualization project built with **Three.js** and **Theatre.js**, inspired by a sleek, shark-like underwater vessel navigating the depths of the ocean. This project is more than code—it’s a reminder of the journey. In the hardest places you must go, you don’t have to be alone. When you’re scared, lost, and on your own, this vessel, rendered in light and motion, carries you back home.

The project brings to life a dynamic, animated underwater scene where a vessel glides through a vast, immersive ocean, symbolizing resilience and companionship. The shark-inspired design, with its fluid movements and intricate details, reflects the strength to face the unknown and the promise of safe return.

## Inspiration
The concept draws from a beautifully crafted wooden shark model by Stephen Lambert (2012), blending organic elegance with mechanical precision. This duality mirrors the project’s core message: even in the deepest, most daunting journeys—whether through code, creativity, or life—there’s a guide to bring you back. The sentiment, *“When you’re scared, lost, and on your own, I’ll carry you back home,”* infuses every line of code, every animation, and every glowing vertex in the scene.

## Features
- **3D Rendering with Three.js**: A shark-like vessel navigates a procedurally generated underwater environment, with realistic lighting, reflections, and particle effects to evoke the ocean’s depths.
- **Animation with Theatre.js**: Smooth, choreographed animations bring the vessel to life, from the rhythmic sway of its fins to the gentle pulse of bioluminescent trails, symbolizing hope in darkness.
- **Immersive Experience**: The scene adapts to user interaction, allowing you to explore the journey at your own pace, with controls to adjust the vessel’s path or pause to reflect on the moment.
- **Emotional Resonance**: The animations and visuals are designed to evoke a sense of companionship, reminding users they’re not alone, even in the toughest moments.

## Tech Stack
- **Three.js**: For rendering the 3D vessel and underwater environment, leveraging WebGL for high-performance graphics.
- **Theatre.js**: For orchestrating complex animations, ensuring the vessel’s movements feel alive and purposeful.
- **JavaScript/HTML5**: The backbone of the project, running seamlessly in modern browsers.
- **GLSL Shaders**: Custom shaders enhance the water effects and vessel’s glow, creating a dreamlike underwater aesthetic.

## Getting Started
To embark on this journey locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd implements-renderable-animatable
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Project**:
   Start a local server (e.g., using `vite` or `http-server`):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open your browser to `http://localhost:5173` (or the specified port) to see the vessel in action.

4. **Explore the Scene**:
   - Use mouse or touch controls to rotate the camera and follow the vessel.
   - Press the “Journey” button (if implemented) to trigger the full animation sequence.
   - Let the visuals and motion remind you: you’re never truly alone.

## Project Structure
- `/src`: Core JavaScript files for the Three.js scene setup and Theatre.js animation logic.
- `/assets`: 3D models, textures, and shaders for the vessel and environment.
- `/public`: Static files like the HTML entry point and favicon.
- `/scripts`: Animation timelines and choreography defined in Theatre.js.

## Contributing
This project is a labor of love, but no journey is complete without companions. Contributions are welcome—whether it’s enhancing the animations, optimizing performance, or adding new features to deepen the emotional impact. Please:
- Fork the repo and create a feature branch.
- Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
- Share how your contribution aligns with the project’s heart: guiding others home.

## Roadmap
- Add interactive storytelling elements, letting users input their own “journey” to personalize the experience.
- Implement dynamic water currents that affect the vessel’s path, symbolizing life’s challenges.
- Optimize for mobile devices to make the journey accessible to all.
- Integrate ambient audio (e.g., soft waves or whale songs) to enhance immersion.

## Acknowledgments
- **Three.js Community**: For empowering creators to build stunning 3D worlds.
- **Theatre.js Team**: For making animation intuitive and expressive.
- **Stephen Lambert**: For the wooden shark sculpture that sparked this vision.
- You, the explorer: For joining this journey and believing in the promise of home.
